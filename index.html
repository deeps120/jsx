    <h2>Software developers at FaceBook whilst working on the facebook app found it difficult to navigate thorugh the code thus, the created a new code language 
        combining javaScript and html.There are several components and functions in jsx like the text tag(<text></text>) which allows you to type a text that wil be displayed on the screen.
        But like creating variables we always have to import the components 
    </h2>
    <h2>While writing or initializing a tag we must always start with an uppercase letter
        eg:"Text",to create buttons we can simply call the button tag '<Button></Button>'
        we can also style the buttons or the texts by adding a title changing the color,width,height and so much more!
        We can also add sounds to the button by copying the sound from soundBible.com and importing it.
        We can then use the touchable opacity tag, "‘TouchableOpacity’ Unlike Button,
         can enclose anything inside them - Text, View, etc." we can also style the button using touchableOpacity
    </h2>
    <h2>to add a sound to the button you can use the onPress function eg(onPress={this.playsound})using this we can create various buttons and display different sounds in them
        note:we can also create classes by importing and exporting the class
